MultiWii Projects for the Walkera Runner Basic and Advanced models

There is a directory for the MultiWii Files for the Runners and then two other files.  
The Runner Config file is a starting point for loading PIDs for the Runners.  You will need to tune PIDs for your own quadcopter.  You will also need to set the flight modes using the Options boxes.
The stk500v2 boot loader for the ATmega2560 is here as a convience.  It is not modified and can be found in other locations.
Basic Runner owners should comment out the GPS and Compass as this will reduce the I2C erros you will see on the MultiWii GUI.
Enjoy!
